<h1> "Atomic Habits" by James Clear </h1>
Published in 2018, the book explores the power of tiny changes in building good habits and breaking 
bad ones. Clear delves into the science behind habits, offering practical strategies to make small 
adjustments that can lead to remarkable transformations over time. The book emphasizes 
the idea that success is a product of daily habits and encourages readers to focus on improving 
processes rather than fixating on goals.
